# Weekly Assignment 4 : Description: E-commerce Product Page
## Objective:
Build a fully responsive e-commerce product page where users can interact with product
images, add items to a cart, and view cart details. The design should closely replicate the layout
and functionality provided in the following Frontend Mentor challenge.
## Requirements:
1. Lightbox Gallery for Product Images:
When a user clicks on the large product image, a lightbox gallery should open, allowing
users to view a zoomed-in version of the image.
2. Thumbnail Image Switcher:
The large product image should switch when a user clicks on any of the small thumbnail
images below. This will give the user a detailed view of the selected product variation.
3. Add to Cart Functionality:
Implement functionality to add items to the shopping cart. The cart should dynamically
update based on the quantity of items added by the user.
4. Cart Management:
Users should be able to view the cart, displaying all items added along with their quantity
and price. The cart must also allow users to remove items from it.
5. Responsive Layout:
Ensure the page adapts smoothly to various screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop). The
product page layout should rearrange itself to provide the best user experience for the
device being used.
6. Hover States for Interactive Elements:
All interactive elements such as buttons, thumbnails, and cart items should display
appropriate hover states to improve usability and provide visual feedback.
## Evaluation Criteria:
● Design Fidelity:
Ensure that the overall design matches the provided Frontend Mentor challenge layout
as closely as possible.

All required interactions, such as the lightbox gallery, cart updates, and responsive
behavior, must work flawlessly.
